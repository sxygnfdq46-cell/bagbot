OBSERVATIONS
============================================================

The backtest completed but no trades were executed. This indicates:

1. The strategy did not generate any EXECUTE_ORDER decisions
2. Possible reasons:
   - Insufficient historical data (only 3 candles)
   - Indicators require more data points to calculate
   - Strategy conditions not met during the test period

Recommendation: Use a larger dataset with more historical candles
to allow indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, ATR) to generate meaningful
signals.
