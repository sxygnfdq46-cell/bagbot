- **Scope** = Purple (breadth of impact)
- **Impact** = Gold (risk assessment)
- **Mode** = Green (execution strategy)

#### Event Hooks
- `onNodeSelect()` - Task node selection
- `onConflictInspect()` - Conflict investigation
- `onApprovalRequest()` - Approval initiation
- `onApprovalGrant()` - Grant approval
- `onApprovalReject()` - Reject approval
